# stdx - Standard Library Extensions

This repository contains a set of [Go](https://go.dev) libraries that provide useful extensions to the standard library. These functions include functions for working with [strings](https://github.com/robicode/stdx/tree/main/stringx), [net/http](https://github.com/robicode/stdx/tree/main/net/httpx), and possibly others.
