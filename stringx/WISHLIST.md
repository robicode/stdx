# stdx/stringx Wanted Functionality

This file contains functions I would like to have added to the library, but either don't have time to implement, are too difficult for me to implement, or I just don't see how they can be converted to Go's syntax and semantics.

If/when they are implemented, I will move their section below into the README and remove them here.

## Functions

Note that I am aware some of these functions are available in either the standard library or `xtrings`, but those versions lack features documented herein.
